## Hi there 👋

I’m **Robin Mulloy** — founder, builder, and CEO of **OperationsCommander (OPS-COM)**, a Canadian SaaS platform that helps organizations simplify parking and security management through one system, one platform, one database.

I’m a lifelong maker, a technology problem-solver, and someone who still believes innovation starts with fixing one small thing that’s been broken for too long. Over the years, that mindset has driven me from web development to fully scaling a platform used across North America.

On LinkedIn, I share lessons from building a business, leading teams, navigating SaaS challenges, and improving the parking and security world with practical, real-world technology.
